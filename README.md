# EDA_Spotify_songs
This Data set is about songs from Spotify with their popularity rating and more information about the songs.
________________________________________
The data-set can be downloaded from Kaggle (Link below). The original data set contains more of 18, 000 rows and 25 columns that contains features of the songs such as lyrics, loudness, length and many more, you can check the meaning of the columns we decided to work on - below. This project explores and analyzes the data. The questions that led us were:
•	To try check if there is a connection between the characteristics of the songs and their popularity, can we predict which characteristics will bring high popularity of the song ?
•	What's the difference or effect (if there is) between the years of the songs and to the popularity ?
•	Analysis of the lyrics and duration songs by genre - to see if they are different or are they the same.
Columns info :
1.	Track name = Song Name | character
2.	Track artist = Song Artist | character
3.	Lyrics = lyrics for the song | character
4.	Track popularity = Song Popularity (0-100) where higher is better | Int
5.	Track album name = Song album name | character
6.	Track album release date = Date when album released | Datetime
7.	Playlist name = Name of playlist | character
8.	Playlist genre = Playlist genre | character
9.	Playlist subgenre = Playlist subgenre | character
10.	danceability = Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing .A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
11.	Energy = is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity
12.	Loudness = The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.
13.	Speechiness = detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.
14.	Acousticness = measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
15.	Instrumentalness = Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content.
16.	Valence = A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
17.	Tempo = The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.
